	Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound 
	(such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format) through one standard 
	library interface. It is released in source code format under the 
		<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">Gnu Lesser General Public License</A>.
<BR><BR>
	The library was written to compile and run on a Linux system but should compile
	and run on just about any Unix. It can also be compiled and run on Win32 systems
	using the Microsoft compiler and MacOS using the Metrowerks compiler (thanks to 
	Ben "Jacobs"). There are directions for compiling libsndfile on these platforms
	in the Win32 and MacOS directories of the source code distribution.
<BR><BR>	
	It was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and big-endian 
	(such as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on little-endian (such as Intel 
	and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems as well as big-endian processor systems such 
	as Motorola 68k, Power PC, MIPS and Sparc. Hopefully the design of the library will 
	also make it easy to extend for reading and writing new sound file formats.
<BR><BR>
    It has so far been compiled and tested on the following systems:
	<UL>
	<LI>i586-pc-linux-gnu (Redhat 5.2 glibc)
 	<LI>powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu (Linux PPC)
 	<LI>mips-sgi-irix5.3 (Native IRIX toolset)
	<LI>sparc-sun-solaris2.7 (gcc)
	<LI>sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1 (gcc)
	<LI>mips-sgi-irix5.3 (gcc)
	<LI>mips-sgi-irix6.3 (cc - native compiler)
	<BR>
	<LI>Win32 (Microsoft Visual C++)
	<LI>MacOS 8.6 (Metrowerks Codewarrior Pro4)
	</UL>

<BR><BR>
	libsndfile is currently capable of reading and writing the following sound file
	formats :
	<UL>
	<LI> Microsoft WAV 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit integer PCM.
    <LI> Microsoft 32 bit floating point PCM. 
    <LI> Microsoft IMA/DVI ADPCM WAV format (16 bits per sample compressed to 4 bits per sample). 
    <LI> Microsoft ADPCM WAV format (16 bits per sample compressed to 4 bits per sample). 
    <LI> Microsoft 8 bit A-law an u-law formats (16 bits per sample compressed to 8 bits per sample). 
    <LI> Microsoft WAV files using GSM 6.10 encoding.
    <LI> Apple/SGI AIFF and AIFC uncompressed 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit integer PCM. 
    <LI> Sun/NeXT AU/SND format (big endian 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit PCM, 8 bit u-law and 8 bit A-law). 
    <LI> Dec AU format (little endian 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit PCM, 8 bit u-law and 8 bit A-law). 
    <LI> Headerless 8kHz 8bit u-law encoded AU/SND files.
    <LI> G721 and G723 ADPCM encoded AU/SND files.
    <LI> RAW header-less PCM files of 8 (signed and unsigned), 16, 24 and 32 bits. The 16, 24 and 32 
			bit files may be big or little endian byte ordering. The 8 bit samples may be signed
			or unsigned values.
    <LI> Amiga uncompressed IFF / 8SVX / 16SV PCM files (8 and 16 bit).
    <LI> Ensoniq PARIS big and little endian, 16 and 24 bit PCM files (.PAF).
	</UL>
<BR>
	Some of the file formats I am also interested in adding are:
	<UL>
	<LI> Soundfont II.
	<LI> Gravis Ultrasound patch files.
	<LI> Kurzweil K2000 sampler files.
	<LI> MPEG Layer 3.
	</UL>
<BR>
	Other file formats may also be added on request.

<FONT SIZE=+20 COLOR="#5050FF"><BR><B>History</B></FONT>

<BR><BR>
	My first attempt at reading and writing WAV files was in 1990 or so under Windows
	3.1. I started using Linux in early 1995 and contributed some code to the 
		<A HREF="http://www.vaxxine.com/ve3wwg/gnuwave.html">wavplay</A>
	program which would eventually mutate into this library. As one of my interests
	is Digital Signal Processing (DSP) I decided that as well as reading data from an
	audio file in the native format (typically 16 bit short integers) it would also 
	be useful to be able to have the library do the conversion to floating point numbers
	for DSP applications. It then dawned on me that whatever file format (anything from
	8 bit unsigned chars, to 32 bit floating point numbers) the library should be able 
	to convert the data to whatever format the library user wishes to use it in. For 
	example, in a sound playback program, the library caller typically wants the sound 
	data in 16 bit short integers to dump into a sound card even though the data in the
	file may be 32 bit floating point numbers (ie Microsoft's WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT 
	format). Another example would be someone doing speech recognition research who has
	recorded some speech as a 16 bit WAV file but wants to process it as double precision 
	floating point numbers.
