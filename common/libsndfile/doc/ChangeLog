1999-11-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/common.c
    Fixed put_int() and put_short() macros used by _psf_hprintf() which were 
    causing seg. faults on Sparc Solaris.

1999-11-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/common.c
    Added string.h to includes. Thanks to Sigbjxrn Skjfret.
    
    * src/svx.c

    Christoph Lauer for finding this problem.

1999-09-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed a bug with incorrect SSND chunk length being written. This also lead
    to finding an minor error in AIFF header parsing. Thanks to Dan Timis for 
    pointing this out.

1999-09-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/paf.c
    Fixed a bug with reading and writing 24 bit stereo PAF files. This problem
    came to light when implementing tests for the new functions which operate
    in terms of frames rather than items.

1999-09-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Modified file type detection to use first 12 bytes of file rather than 
    file name extension. Required this because NIST files use the same 
    filename extension as Microsoft WAV files.
    
    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h
    Added short, int and double read/write functions which work in frames rather 
    than items. This was originally suggested by Maurizio Umberto Puxeddu
    
1999-09-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/svx.c
    Finished off implementation of write using __psf_hprintf().

1999-09-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/common.h
    Added a buffer to SF_PRIVATE for writing the header. This is required
    to make generating headers for IFF/SVX files easier as well as making
    it easier to do re-write the headers which will be required when 
    sf_rewrite_header() is implemented.

    * src/common.c
    Implemented __psf_hprintf() function. This is an internal function
    which is documented briefly just above the code.
    
1999-09-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed a bug in sf_write_raw() where it was returning incorrect values
    (thanks to Richard Dobson for finding this one). Must put in a test 
    routine for sf_read_raw and sf_write_raw.
    
    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed default FORMsize in __aiff_open_write ().

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added copy of filename to internal data structure. IFF/SVX files 
    contain a NAME header chunk. Both sf_open_read() and sf_open_write()
    copy the file name (less the leading path information) to the
    filename field.
    
    * src/svx.c
    Started implementing writing of files.

1999-08-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    Fixed calculation of datalength when reading SSND chunk. Thanks to
    Sigbjørn Skjæret for pointing out this error.

1999-07-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h src/raw.c
    Further fixing of #includes for MacOS.

1999-07-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added call to ferror () in main header parsing loop of __XXX_open_read
    functions. This should fix problems on platforms (MacOS, AmigaOS) where 
    fseek()ing or fread()ing beyond the end of the file puts the FILE*
    stream in an error state until clearerr() is called.
    
    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for RAW header-less PCM files.
    
    * src/common.h
    Moved definition of struct tribyte to pcm.c which is the only place
    which needs it.

    * src/pcm.c
    Modified all code which assumed sizeof (struct tribyte) == 3. This code
    did not work on MacOS. Thanks to Ben "Jacobs" for pointing this out.

    * src/au.c
    Removed <sys/stat.h> from list of #includes (not being used).
    
    * src/sndfile.c
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.
    
    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.
    
    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific typedef for off_t.
    
    * MacOS-readme.txt
    New file with instructions for building libsndfile under MacOS. Thanks
    to Ben "Jacobs" for supplying these instructions.
    
1999-07-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * configure.in
    Removed sndfile.h from generated file list as there were no longer
    any autoconf substitutions being made.
    
    * src/raw.c
    New file for handling raw header-less PCM files. In order to open these
    for read, the user must specify format, pcmbitwidth and channels in the
    SF_INFO struct when calling sf_open_read ().
    
    * src/sndfile.c
    Added support for raw header-less PCM files.    
    
1999-07-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * examples/sfinfo.c
    Removed options so the sfinfo program always prints out all the information.
    
1999-07-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/alaw.c
    New file for A-law encoding (similar to u-law).
    
    * tests/alaw_test.c
    New test program to test the A-law encode/decode lookup tables.
    
    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Added tests for a-law encoded WAV, AU and AULE files.
    
1999-07-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c src/au.c

    * src/au.c src/ulaw.c
    Finished implementation of u-law encoded AU files.
    
    * src/wav.c
    Implemented reading and writing of u-law encoded WAV files.

    Changed name of adpcm_test.c to lossy_comp_test.c. This test program
    will now be used to test Ulaw and Alaw encoding as well as APDCM.
    Added tests for Ulaw encoded WAV files.

1999-07-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/adpcm_test.c

1999-07-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/aiff.c
    In __aiff_open_read () prevented fseek()ing beyond end of file which 
    was causing trouble on MacOS with the MetroWerks compiler. Thanks to
    Ben "Jacobs" for pointing this out.
    
    *src/wav.c
    Fixed as above in __wav_open_read ().

1999-07-01    Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    Added -Wconversion to CFLAGS. 
    
    * src/*.c tests/*.c examples/*.c
    Fixed all warnings resulting from use of -Wconversion. 

1999-06-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c
    Added fact chunk handling on read and write for all non WAVE_FORMAT_PCM
    WAV files.

    * src/wav_ima.c
    Changed block alignment to be dependant on sample rate. This should make
    WAV files created with libsndfile compatible with the MS Windows media
    players.
    
    * tests/adpcm_test.c
    Reimplemented adpcm_test_short and implemented adpcm_test_int and adpcm_test_double.
    Now have full testing of IMA ADPCM WAV file read, write and seek.

1999-06-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav_float.c
    Fixed function prototype for x86f2d_array () which was causing ocassional 
    seg. faults on Sparc Solaris machines.

1999-06-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed bug in __aiff_close where the length fields in the header were

1999-06-12    Erik de Castro Lopo     <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * Win32/*
    Added a contribution from Albert Faber to allow libsndfile to compile
    under Win32 systems. libsndfile will now be used as part of LAME the
    the MPEG 1 Layer 3 encoder (http://internet.roadrunner.com/~mt/mp3/).

1999-06-11    Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * configure.in
    Changed to reflect previous changes.
    
    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed incorrect calculation of bytespersec header field (IMA ADPCM only).
    
    Fixed bug when writing from int or double data to IMA ADPCM file. Will need 
    to write test code for this.
    
    Fixed bug in __ima_write () whereby the length of the current block was 
    calculated incorrectly. Thanks to Jongcheon Park for pointing this out.

1999-03-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/*.c
    Changed all read/write/lseek function calls to fread/fwrite/
    fseek/ftell and added error checking of return values from
    fread and fwrite in critical areas of the code.
    
    * src/au.c
    Fixed incorrect datasize element in AU header on write.
    
    * tests/error_test.c

    string. This will avoid embarrassing real world core dumps.

1999-03-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added handling for unknown chunk markers in the file. 

1999-03-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Filled in missing error strings in SndfileErrors array. Missing entries 
    can cause core dumps when calling sf_error-str (). Thanks to Sam 
    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com> for finding this problem.

1999-03-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Work on wav_ms_adpcm.c uncovered a bug in __ima_read () when reading 
    stereo files. Caused by not adjusting offset into buffer of decoded
    samples for 2 channels. A similar bug existed in __ima_write ().
    Need a test for stereo ADPCM files.
    
    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Decoder working correctly.
    
1999-03-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com>.
    
    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed bug when reading beyond end of data section due to not
    checking pima->blockcount.
    This uncovered __ima_seek () bug due to pima->blockcount being set 
    before calling __ima_init_block ().

1999-03-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c
    Started implementing MS ADPCM decoder. 
    If file is WAVE_FORMAT_ADPCM and length of data chunk is odd, this
    encoder seems to add an extra byte. Why not just give an even data
    length? 

1999-03-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c
    Split code out of wav.c to create wav_float.c and wav_ima_adpcm.c.
    This will make it easier to add and debug other kinds of WAV files
    in future.

1999-03-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/
    Added adpcm_test.c which implements test functions for
    IMA ADPCM reading/writing/seeking etc.

    incorrect read count when reading past end of file.
    Fixed bug in sf_seek () when seeking backwards from end of file.

    * tests/read_seek_test.c
    Added multiple read test to short_test(), int_test () and
    double_test ().
    Added extra chunk to all test WAV files to test that reading
    stops at end of 'data' chunk.

1999-02-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for little DEC endian AU files.

    * src/au.c
    Add handling for DEC format little endian AU files.
     
1999-02-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/aiff.c src/au.c src/wav.c
    Add __psf_sprintf calls during header parsing.
     
    * src/sndfile.c src/common.c
    Implement sf_header_info (sndfile.c) function and __psf_sprintf (common.c).

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for 8 bit PCM files (WAV, AIFF and AU).

    * src/au.c src/aiff.c
    Add handling of 8 bit PCM data format.
     
    * src/aiff.c
    On write, set blocksize in SSND chunk to zero like everybody else.
    
1999-02-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed bug in let2s_array (cptr was not being initialised).

    * src/sndfile.c:
    Fixed bug in sf_read_raw and sf_write_raw. sf_seek should
    now work when using these functions.

1999-02-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c:
    Force test_buffer array to be double aligned. Sparc Solaris
    requires this.

1999-02-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed a bug which was causing errors in the reading
    and writing of 24 bit PCM files.
    
    * doc/api.html
    Finished of preliminary documentaion.

1999-02-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/aiff.c:
    Changed reading of 'COMM' chunk to avoid reading an int
    which overlaps an int (4 byte) boundary.
