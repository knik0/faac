This is libsndfile, 0.0.16

libsndfile is a library of C routines for reading and writing 
files containing sampled audio data. 

The src/ directory contains the source code for library itself.

The doc/ directory contains the libsndfile documentation.

The examples/ directory contains examples of how to write code using
libsndfile. 'wav32_aiff24' converts a WAV file containing 32 bit floating 
point data into a 24 bit PCM AIFF file. 'sndfile2oct' dumps the audio
data of a file in a human readable format. 'sfconvert' is the beginnings
of a audio file format conversion utility. 'make_sine' generates a WAV
file containing one cycle of a sine wave with 4096 sample points in
32 bit floating point format. 'sfinfo' opens a sound file and prints
out information about that file.

The tests/ directory contains programs which link against libsndfile
and test its functionality.

The Win32/ directory contains files and documentation to allow libsndfile
to compile under Win32 with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

The MacOS/ directory contains files and documentation to allow libsndfile
to compile under MacOS with the Metrowerks compiler.

The src/GSM610 directory contains code written by Jutta Degener and Carsten 
Bormann. Their original code can be found at :

OTHER PLATFORMS
---------------

To compile libsndfile on platforms which have a Bourne Shell compatible
shell, an ANSI C compiler and a make utility should require no more that
the following three commands :
		./configure
		make
		make install
		
For platforms without the required shell, it is usually sufficient to 
create an approriate config.h file in the src/ directory with correct
values for the following #defines  (this would work for AmigaOS) :

#define __BIG_ENDIAN__ 1
#define __LITTLE_ENDIAN__ 0
#define CAN_READ_WRITE_x86_IEEE 0
