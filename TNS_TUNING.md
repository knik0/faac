# FAAC Quantization Thresholds & TNS Tuning

This document justifies the psychoacoustic thresholds and factors used in `libfaac/quantize.c`, as required by project maintenance standards. These values were derived via extensive feature sweeps and validated against GitHub CI regression suites.

## Quantization Constants

### `NOISEFLOOR` (0.40)
- **Purpose**: Defines the minimum RMS energy for a scale factor band to be considered non-silent.
- **Justification**: Set to 0.40 to match the established project baseline. Feature sweeps showed that higher values (0.45) improved throughput but caused MOS regressions on sensitive samples in the VSS suite (e.g., C_17_ECHO_ML).

## Masking Target Factors

### `NOISETONE` (0.2) and `TONEMASK` (0.45)
- **Purpose**: Weighting factors for the noise-like (average energy) and tone-like (peak energy) components of the masking target.
- **Justification**: Standard proportions that balance audio fidelity and bitrate accuracy across the 16-128kbps/ch range.

### `SHORT_PENALTY` (0.45)
- **Purpose**: Tightens the masking target for short-window blocks.
- **Justification**: Ensures higher precision for transient signals, reducing pre-echo artifacts.

### `SHORT_FLOOR_MULT` (1.0)
- **Purpose**: Scales the total energy comparison threshold for short-window blocks.
- **Justification**: Maintained at 1.0 to preserve baseline behavior for transient frames.

## Energy Floor Factors (Divergence Prevention)

The `target_floor` logic prevents the masking target from collapsing on quiet upper bands, preventing aggressive truncation by the quantizer.

### `AVGE_FLOOR_FACTOR` (0.0010)
- **Derivation**: 10^( -30 dB / 10 ) = 0.0010.
- **Justification**: Clamps the band-to-frame average energy ratio at -30 dB. Found to be the optimal balance for preserving high-frequency "air" without wasting bits.

### `MAXE_FLOOR_FACTOR` (0.0050)
- **Derivation**: 10^( -23 dB / 10 ) approx 0.0050.
- **Justification**: Clamps the peak energy ratio at -23 dB as a secondary safety net for tonal components in quiet bands.
